-=Gravity=-

- Gravity; player dies if gravity > 0 and reaches bottom row
- When gravity > 0, cannot accelerate east/west unless blocked to the south
- Cannot have gravity < 0

- Projectile motion:
  * x(t) = vt, where v = initial horizontal velocity
  * y(t) = -1/2*g*t^2 + vt + y_0, where g = some constant, v = initial vertical velocity, y_0 = initial height.
			But we are using rows (which increase in downwards direction), so presumably we change some signs in that equation.
			Initial vertical velocity is 0 if Herc simply walks off an edge, or some constant if Herc jumps

- Kinetic Energy strategy:

Level has Gravity, player has JumpStrength and KineticEnergy.

While KineticEnergy is positive, moves up (Gravity) locations per cycle, and bank decrements by (Gravity) (minimium 0).
While KineticEnergy is zero, Player falls (Gravity) spot per cycle. 
If player is blocked south, KineticEnrgy is reset to zero.
KineticEnergy is increased by JumpStrength when player jumps.
Player may jump only when blocked south. 
If blocked south, Player may jump even if KineticEnergy is already nonzero.
If player passes through an object while falling (gem, ammo, etc.), call its OnTouch method.
