- Door / key
- Bullet should pass through and this should then display again
	- Abstract out this behavior as a strategy
- In refresh logic, need to re-show things that were previously overlapped (eg bullet passing over key)
- Status bar
- Implement and test "seek" behavior for bullet
- Unit tests
- Logic to remove objects that are beyond the bounds of the level (eg bullets).
	- Improve bullet behavior; they get stuck at screen edges
	- Really weird behavior if player goes to edge
