- Bullet can pass through wall if shot from an adjacent Location; fix this.
  - Similarly, cannot break a breakable wall from an adjacent location.
- Performance profiler: Figure out why everything gets so slow as the number of objects increases
- Status bar
- Implement and test "seek" behavior for bullet
- Unit tests
- Logic to remove objects that are beyond the bounds of the level (eg bullets).
	- Improve bullet behavior; they get stuck at screen edges
	- Really weird behavior if player goes to edge
