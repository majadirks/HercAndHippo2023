-= Desired features =-
- Bug: in SoManyBullets() level, if you resize the buffer, the background turns green.
- Research faster console writing:
	* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29920056/c-sharp-something-faster-than-console-write
	* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2754518/how-can-i-write-fast-colored-output-to-console
- Custom color enum (library should not use Console-specific features, including ConsoleColor. Console app should do conversion.)
- Segregate interfaces:
	* Separate out ILocatable (Location) and IConsoleDisplayable (ConsoleColor foreground, ConsoleColor background, ConsoleDisplayString)
	* Genericize Level to support other interfaces besides IConsoleDisplayable, or so it depends only on ILocatable
			(so we could have a non-ASCII visual representation that doesn't depend on ConsoleDisplayString method,
			 or write tests without implementing these ASCII-specific methods)
- Level editor
- Status bar
- Implement and test "seek" behavior for bullet
- Enemies: archers, poodles
- Hippo and goal
- Trophies and transporters
- Gravity; player dies if gravity > 0 and reaches bottom row, or gravity < 0 and reaches top row
- Torches and darkness
- Gems
- Lives
- Scrolls
- Message text
- Custom programmable objects (support a superset of ZZT-OOP)
- Objects can send each other messages and react accordingly.
- Music / sound effects
- Saved games
- Cheat codes
	
-=Unit tests=-

Enemies: 
* Bullet:
   - dies when reaches level edge (min row/col, corner row/col) 
			(check that it hasn't just moved beyond! Also check that it can actually reach the edge. Including moving > spot int in row/column one)
   - dies if beyond level edge (eg if shot from edge and placed beyond initially)
   - Two adjacent bullets do not interfere with each other
   - Can shoot something at the last column/row of a level (eg breakable wall)
   - Can be shot from bottom right corner of a level

Environment:
* Wall:
   - Stops and removes a bullet
   - Stops a player

* Breakable Wall:
   - When shot, stops bullet and dies
   - Stops a player

* Door:
   - Stops and removes a bullet
   - Stops a player without the correct key
   - When touched, if player has key, door dies, player moves where door was, and player loses key

Goodies:
* Ammo:
   - When touched: dies, increases player's ammo count, and player ends where ammo was

* Key:
   - When touched: dies, key is added to player's inventory, and player ends where key was
