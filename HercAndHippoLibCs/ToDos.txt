- Level editor
- Status bar:
   Player: Health, ammo, inventory, Kinetic Energy, player location, 
   Hippo: hippo location if any, hippo locked, 
   Level: gravity, cycle count
- Implement and test "seek" behavior for bullet

Tests:
	- Test ManhattanDistance()
	- Test that Driver moves player after cycle
	- Test that, when falling due to gravity,
	     if player stops at motion-blocking object,
		 its OnTouch() method is called once
    - In level with gravity, if player is blocked South, can MoveSouth to touch that object
	- Test hippo falling to end of level (never blocked South) - what do we expect, and what actually happens?

- Trophies and transporters
- Gravity; player dies if gravity > 0 and reaches bottom row, or gravity < 0 and reaches top row
- Torches and darkness
- Gems
- Enemies: archers, poodles
- Lives
- Scrolls
- Message text
- Custom programmable objects (support a superset of ZZT-OOP)
- Objects can send each other messages and react accordingly.
- Music / sound effects
- Saved games
- Cheat codes
- Converter to convert ZZT worlds (including ZZT-OOP) to Herc and Hippo worlds???
- Look into Unity or MAUI for creating non-ASCII interface and mobile version

  -=Unit Test=-
  If player moves for a while in a direction, player never hinders its own motion
