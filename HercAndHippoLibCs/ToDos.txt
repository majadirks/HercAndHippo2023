-=Unit tests=-

* Test correct calculation of level width and height
* Player:
   - movement within level
   - no movement west of min col or right of level width
   - no movement north of min row or south of level height

* Bullet:
   - correctly calls OnTouch method of anything it shoots
   - Ignores objects without OnShoot methods
   - moves with each cycle in correct direction
   - Does not move if it was stopped (eg by wall)
   - dies when reaches level edge (check that it hasn't just moved beyond!)
   - Two adjacent bullets do not interfere with each other
   - Can shoot something at the last column/row of a level (eg breakable wall)
   - Can be shot from bottom right corner of a level
