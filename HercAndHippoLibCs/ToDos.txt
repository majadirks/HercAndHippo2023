-= Desired features =-
- Research faster console writing:
	* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29920056/c-sharp-something-faster-than-console-write
	* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2754518/how-can-i-write-fast-colored-output-to-console
- Segregate interfaces:
	* Separate out ILocatable (Location) and IConsoleDisplayable (ConsoleColor foreground, ConsoleColor background, ConsoleDisplayString)
	* Genericize Level to support other interfaces besides IConsoleDisplayable, or so it depends only on ILocatable
			(so we could have a non-ASCII visual representation that doesn't depend on ConsoleDisplayString method,
			 or write tests without implementing these ASCII-specific methods)
- Level editor
- Status bar
- Implement and test "seek" behavior for bullet
- Enemies: archers, poodles
- Hippo and goal
- Trophies and transporters
- Gravity; player dies if gravity > 0 and reaches bottom row, or gravity < 0 and reaches top row
- Torches and darkness
- Gems
- Lives
- Saved games
- Cheat codes
	
-=Unit tests=-
* Player:
   - Equality of player records (currently fails unless inventories point to same HashSet in memory)

* Inventory
   - Equality and HashCode equality by object comparison (for both empty and nonempty)

Enemies: 

* Bullet:
   - Correctly calls OnShot method of anything it shoots
   - Calls OnShot from its initial location (before moving) so player can shoot adjacent objects
   - Ignores objects without OnShoot methods
   - Moves with each cycle in correct direction
   - Does not move if it was stopped (eg by wall)
   - dies when reaches level edge (check that it hasn't just moved beyond!)
   - dies if beyond level edge (eg if shot from edge and placed beyond initially)
   - Two adjacent bullets do not interfere with each other
   - Can shoot something at the last column/row of a level (eg breakable wall)
   - Can be shot from bottom right corner of a level

Environment:

* Wall:
   - Stops and removes a bullet
   - Stops a player

* Breakable Wall:
   - When shot, stops bullet and dies
   - Stops a player

* Door:
   - Stops and removes a bullet
   - Stops a player without the correct key
   - When touched, if player has key, door dies, player moves where door was, and player loses key

Goodies:

* Ammo:
   - When touched: dies, increases player's ammo count, and player ends where ammo was

* Key:
   - When touched: dies, key is added to player's inventory, and player ends where key was
