* Acceleration applies only to East/West motion. 
  - North/south acceleration is to be handled by gravity and
     some sort of "vertical acceleration" variable that depends on the level's gravity value.

  - if (moving west) velocity -= some constant
  - if (moving east) velocity += same constant
  - if (not moving either direction and velocity > 0) decrease velocity by the same constant
  - if (not moving either direction and velocity < 0) increase velocity by the same constant.
  - if abs(velocity) <= some threshold, set velocity = 0
  - Cap out at fixed max velocity
  - Boost modifier increases the max velocity to a higher cap
  
  - Upshot: accelerate/decelerate at same constant rate
