# Herc and Hippo
Herc and Hippo is a side scrolling game in which Hercules must safely bring a hippo to safety!
For now it has a simple console front end, though I hope to add different graphical options in the future.

This is an in-progress personal project for playing around with functional programming techniques in C#.
